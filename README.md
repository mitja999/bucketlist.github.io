# StorageApplication
Build a simple object storage application using Angular 5.x with following requirements:

list all buckets
delete a single bucket
upload an object to a bucket

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
